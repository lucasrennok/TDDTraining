# :closed_book: TDDTraining

I used this repository to learn a bit of Test-Driven Development. This was made following a set of videos made by a youtube channel called "Mango".

## How to use

First, clone this repository. After that use npm test to start jest script and watch if someone is wrong with the tests made.
